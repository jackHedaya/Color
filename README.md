# ColorWordEncrypter

This is a program that encrypts (decrypts coming soon) a message in an image by converting each character to its ASCII equivalent and and adds each value to create a color. The colors are then displayed in the form of rectangles.

# Example

"G I T H U B"

G => 71     I => 73     T => 84     H => 74     U => 85     B => 66.

RGB ( 71, 73, 84 )      RGB ( 74, 85, 66 )
