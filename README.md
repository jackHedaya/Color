# ColorWordEncrypter

This is a program that encrypts (decrypts coming soon) a message in an image by converting each character to its ASCII equivalent and and adds each value to create a color. The colors are then displayed in the form of rectangles.

After rereading this code it has come to my attention that it is a nightmare.

I will definitely need to rewrite this with comments.

# Example

"G I T H U B"

G => 71     <br>
I => 73     <br>
T => 84     <br>
H => 74     <br>
U => 85     <br>
B => 66<br>

RGB ( 71, 73, 84 )  <br>    RGB ( 74, 85, 66 )
